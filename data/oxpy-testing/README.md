# Misc
- to generate the configuration file, run `confGenerator input 20`. Note there is a minor error if we set `use_average_seq = true` in the input file -- it asks for a `seq_dep_file` when it shouldn't.
- should ask what happens if you don't set `max_backbone_force`
- also weirdly requiring a value for `restart_step_counter`
  - this is append vs overwrite. 1 will overwrite, 0 will append
  - check documentation for if this is there
- `dt` argument for input file isn't listed on documentation
- also asking for `energy_file` which isn't documented
  - what *is* the energy file?
  - documentation for what's in the energy file?
- headers for observables?
  - backbone, bonded excluded volume, stacking, non-bonded excluded volume, hydrogen bonding, cross stacking and coaxial stacking
- when you split up the energy for an observable, it doesn't also give you the total?
- is there any explicit scheme for relaxing?
- Note: Erik only uses `pair_energy` observable
- what file type is input? would be good to know for emacs
  - A: no particular file type. Custom from Tom.
- default is overwrite to trajectory
  - append vs overwrite is a global thing. this is some input option
- ranges for the subterms of the potentials in the documentation
- yup and nope are good for boolean values
