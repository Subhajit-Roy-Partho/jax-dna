# Potential Applications

## Benchmark
- More specifically: set of data/test-cases to which a model should conform
- Note: more of a contribution than an application

## Parameter Fitting and Potential Design
- oxDNA 3 post doc with some mechanical data
- redo peter's sequence specificity applications
- redo tom's parameter fitting
  - Do we need to fit things like stacking and backbone heights?
- redo oxDNA 2 parameter fitting
  - E.g. Gamma was determined by ''visual inspection''
- Fit a (equivariant) neural network as a potential
  - Pass in all radial and angular parameters
  - Could try to extract a symbolic expression from it
- Try a different spring rather than the FENE spring? The log term is annoying
- the madrid DNA thing. MadDNA?

## Inverse Design
- Secondary structure
- Tertiary structure

## Misc.
- Blender visualization. Convert to all-atom?
- Really wonder how speed (e.g. of XLA) compares with CUDA
