# Misc. Notes

Current TODO:
- test energy subterms
  - have a couple more examples
- update simulate code to have output directory
  - and add to gitignore
- think about best way to order things better than now...
- confirm that you can run both with and without dictionaries/arrays
- get some optimizations running
  - compare dictionary vs. array
  - compare checkpointing, various batch sizes and # epochs
- add neighbors in...
