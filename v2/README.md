# Misc. Notes

Current TODO:
- test energy subterms
  - have a nice file for this
  - ah! use the observable rather than the `oat` thing. but, don't forget to check the github and the slack...
  - make a `data` directory in `test`
- add coax back in and recehck energy subterms
- think about best way to order things better than now...
- confirm that you can run both with and without dictionaries/arrays
- get some optimizations running
  - compare dictionary vs. array
- add neighbors in...
