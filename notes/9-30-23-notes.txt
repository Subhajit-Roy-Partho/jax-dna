periodic boundaries may work differently in jax-md vs. oxDNA. E.g. definition of (0,0,0) may be ifferent. should check. Could lead to the bad losses.

Can we do free boundary conditions in oxdna?

Should check source of differences in energy calcluations. Go term by term with stacking and changing them for energy calcluatoin

really might want to center the last conf every time

OK. This for sure has to do with boundary conditions...

could maybe try setting fix_diffusion to 1 to simulate free boundary conditions...

also, need to think about the 3->5 vs. 5->3
