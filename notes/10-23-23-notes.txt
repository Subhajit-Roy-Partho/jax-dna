jax on cpu
- try this for now

two gpus


check memory usage via nvidia-smi
- we are running out of memory past 7 simulations

could even decrease jax memoryp re-allocation
- meh. this seems annoying

could also do 6 instead of 4. then 9 instead of 8, etc. see if there's consistency in the number of failling, a "critical point"
- yes -- 7 simulations
