;; This buffer is for text that is not saved, and for Lisp evaluation.
;; To create a file, visit it with C-x C-f and enter text in its buffer.

first, check if we can use orderedsparse with th eexperiment. then we don't need that normalization factor.

then, continue on -- basically mask out the relevant parts of the sum and divide by the normalization factor

then, implement a new simulate file that uses neighbor lists
- or, just update th eexisting one



see `use_sparse_neighbor_lists` in factory.py
