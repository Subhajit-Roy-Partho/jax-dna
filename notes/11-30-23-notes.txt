For tomorrow:
- clean the above running average thing. Can do something like this for a reference trajectory. Check that it would generalize to other duplex lengths, etc
- write one that doesn't deal with traj_hist files. One that will transfer to optimization -- should just take reference states, ref energies (for eventual reweighting), array of order parameters for every state, params. This will do all the extrapolation, etc.
- write a forward thing that simulates a melting temperature. Again, should generalize to different lengths.
- Then, optimize w.r.t it


note: I think we only have to do the extrpapolation once b/c it's transformed into an expectation over T, not T'. But we hvae to count every time because it's a weighted count.
