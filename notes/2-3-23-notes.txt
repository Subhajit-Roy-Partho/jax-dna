- add command line flags for external force
- generate a centered version of the persistence length start configuration so we can stop dealing with these periodic effects when visualizing
- write analysis for force extnesion curves:
  - measure displacement between the two base pairs we are considering projected onto th eaxis of force
    - dot product of their displacement and the force directoin
  - sampel every 5000
- relax the 110 bp duplex and generate some initial force extension curves
- persistence length
  - compute avg from my long one
  - wait on long ones from megan
  - and compare with the oxdna analysis script
