have to first test nested dictionary merging

want to test this dictionary merging thing. Considering whether or not to separate out params from get_energy_fn. A proposal:
- have a set_params that sets the model params
  - test that we can get non-zero gradients through tihs
- have a get_energy_fn that doesn't take any parameters but just returns the energy function

then test the energy function
