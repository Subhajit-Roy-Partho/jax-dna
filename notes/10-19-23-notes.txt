Things to do next:
- use the (centered) old repeat final states as the initial state for the next refernece run
- GPU!!
  - check energy values
  - also, add option to not print energy values to run much faster
  - do more samples, eval convergence
- have a second oxdna-bin to run things in parallel
- read in states more efficiently
- could also try a higher target lp -- may be more stable
