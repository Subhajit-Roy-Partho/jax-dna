regarding next simulatoins to run:
- number of base pairs -> Q
- distance -> min distance (might need rescaling here)

code refactor to make things clear to both us and Michael
- both for 1D, 2D metadynamics, as well as for melting temp calculation

oxDNA investigations
- RNA vs. DNA order parameters -- e.g. why is min dist not being used for RNA? *How* is min distance being used for DNA? Why do they not get unphysical things for low #'s of base pairs?
- when (and when not) using min dist, how many steps does it take to converge to melting temperature?
