run the following starting from unbound:
stride: 500
n_steps: 50000000
init_height: 0.005
width_cv1: 0.01
width_cv2: 0.05
d_critical: 10.0
wall_strength: 1000.0
dt: 0.005
temp: 300
top_path: data/simple-helix/generated.top
conf_path: data/simple-helix/start.conf
save_every: 100000
plot_every: -1
save_output: True
well_tempered: False
delta_T: 20.0
smooth_min_k: 100.0
cv1_method: ratio-contacts
cv2_method: com-dist
ref_top_path: data/simple-helix/generated.top
ref_conf_path: data/simple-helix/start.conf
q_lambda: 1.2
q_gamma: 60.0
q_threshold: 0.6




things to run:
- well-tempered with 2700
  - use initial height of ~0.17
  - make sure to uncomment the height_0 product in front
  - actually, with just deltaT in denominator, kT = 0.9
- above
- run normal oxDNA for 10^5/6 steps to comput ecorrelation length
  - maybe just use cpp version at this point?
  - no, run with ours because different thermostat. maybe 10^6?
    - track the q's every ~1000
    - want to compute the correlation length. this should be the stride.
- another one to compute position histogram (starting from bound)
  - want to record interstrand distance and Q
  - want to determine the right widths
  - widths should be on the order of the free energy well
  - track each CV from an unbiased simulation. plot histogram. fit to gaussian. take half of width of gaussian as CV width
- another one to estimate the height
  - on the order of 0.1 kcal/mol at RT
  - 0.17 in our simulation units
- need to look into how to share an array across multiple GPUs for multiple walkers
