could pass around heights/sigmas/centers to the energy function.
- this will require a large dot product every time. basically computing the sum of gaussians every time...

we would really like to accumulate the bias during a scan
- but i doubt we can accumulate a function...
- could we accumulate on a discreteiezd mesh that approximates the function?

next:
- fix langevin issue with new JAX-MD version -- just use the one in the repo
  - test with simulate.py
- test metad.py for bugs without any energy function
  - really just updating the gaussian stuff
- make a new energy function that incorporates all of this
- run the thing, plot the resulting sum of gaussians
- later: well tempered heights

ok... now do the following:
- setup infrastructure to accumulate centers/widths/heights appropriately
- then, and only then, setup infrastructure for new energy function such that we sum all the gaussians every time with a dot product
