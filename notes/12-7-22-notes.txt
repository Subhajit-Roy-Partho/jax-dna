things at some point:
- run something in oxdna (or ours) pulling a duplex apart
  - when the energy terms go to 0, that's the critical distance we should use
  - do determine the critical distance -- or just take the max of all those parameters. pick the biggest minimum
- also collect histogram for the distance and angles to determine the width of the gaussians for our new collective variale
- could start to talk about mechanical stuff in the meantime
- ... unbiasing Metadynamics sims...
