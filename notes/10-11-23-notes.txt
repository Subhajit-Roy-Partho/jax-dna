OK. We will probably want to run their persistence length script. Therefore, we should probably install oxpy. Can do using our fixed oxDNA installation. Will need to reocmpile withthe python option on.

TODO:
- test oat persistence length
- try oxDNA_analysis_tools.persistence_length in a python script
- just do the above, and then as well as our own. Check for equality/matching/etc.
- then do the GPU thing
- then optimize!



in the oxdna code, they normalize Lp based on l0. So it is just number of nucleotides!!
- note that we have slight discrepancies with their calculated Lp. Should really comprae our correlations to theirs. If they don't match, maybe it's a binning thing.
