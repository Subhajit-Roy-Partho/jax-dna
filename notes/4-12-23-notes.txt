general:
- max stuff
  - test other parmeters, 256 thing. then move onto coaxial stacking
- submit baker paper (and run by michael)
- do all the relevant reading
- fill out that google doc for nature comms stuff
- read
- run


oxdna
- get true neigfhbbor thresholds
  - DONE: it's 1.6ish (simulation uints), ish becauese you add verlet skin and you take a max, BUT our rcutoff for that low doesn't work because at low cutoffs we bufferoverflow so we aren't actually including all neighbors within that range
- benchmark neighbor lists
  - DONE FOR NOW: For elastic modulus system, at least in interactive mode, it's really not faster. Also, note that when we run, we shouldn't return the final trajectory because this takes extra time...
- profile -- why are we slower than oxDNA CPU?
  - memory with pprof
  - compute with tensorboard
- check clipping results
- look into clipping strategies
  - e.g. how much Megan/Jamie clipped for MC stuff, as well as REINFORCE vs REINFORCE + correction
  - included in this is a conversation about batching with the REINFORCE trick and the degree to which it's necessary for equilibriums tatistics/ path-independent statistics
  - TODO: Megan is going to prepare an explanation on gradients in the context of hwat she did with Jamie. Then we will all compare...
- talk big picture, go off and read papers, especially Sams, learn about exploding gradients
  - note we can also isolate where the problem is coming from (e.g. shorter steps, dummy loss function, dummy energy terms, drop out energy terms)

For later (oxDNA)
- maybe look into umbrella sampling for ocmputing WLC fit
- VMMC metadynamics for melting temperatures?
