- rerun simulation 2e7 with sigmoidal CV
  - what we want from this:
    - min # of bps is 0
    - at large distances, tight band around 0 or exactly at 0
- then, if its 1D, then just directly add the bias potential
  - note: will have to think about how to plot if truly 1D
  - otherwise, think more...
- then, compute the probability of hybridized and prob of unhybridized by integrating e^(-beta*G)
  - need to pick some distance threshold. Prob just 1 to start
  - this will give us two probabilities
- take ratio of the two probabilities
- compute tom's correction on this ratio
  - f_inf -- fraction of bound in the bulk. inf corresponds to bulk solution
- then, need to do this at 5 different temperatures
  - e.g. increments of 10?
  - could also do histogram reweighting
- plot 1/f_inf to get characteristic melting curve shape
  - find T at which fraction is 0.5. Note that Tom didn't fit to width


TODO: run the 2e7 thing...
